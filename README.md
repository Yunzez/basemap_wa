# World basemap :earth_asia:
___

**It is a simple world base map example that has a max zoom-in value of seven. It covers the whole earth.**

**At the zoom in level of seven, major cities, roads, and parks will be showed in the basemap, which is enough for most of global analysis.**

**The benefit of this is that the size of the tiles can be very small thus respond quickly**

*The basemap is produced using QTiles and MaxBox Studio*
